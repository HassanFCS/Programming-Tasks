I make a map of Transition Table.
And traverse Through first state to Final State.
And then check my final state in SS as SS changing from first state
to final state according to the string index.
For Null State i have to use _getch() so i can identify if user just 
pressed enter.
if user enter some number which is not in character set (0 and 1) program 
will end.
