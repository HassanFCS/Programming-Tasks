First of all i make a Struct of TT Basically its each State and it should
be TS (Transition State)
there is a char State and Vector of Set of NextStates.
bool IsAccepting for check on which state we will be on final state.
There is Class of NFA_Automata have a vector of Struct TT,,A String
WA (Working Alphabets),,Char SS(Staring State),,string SA(State Alphabets)
on which states i am working(ABCDT)
WAIndex returns the WA index.
SIndex returns State Alphabet index.
StringAcceptable returns either we have to accept this string or not and also
store States in queue Solutions.
if i am on the final state and read another value from the Input string.
i pop that string and didn't add into my Solution queue.
Read reads the data from the File.
PrintSolutions prints the strings in the queue.
Print prints the Data about the string which we read from the file(Data).
